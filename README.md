# electiongraphgenerator
This is a small project that I made in order to generate graphs for different elections in the U.S. House of Representatives (currently a work in progress)

script1.R is code that uses data that turned out to not provide enough relevant data, though I was still able to create the function with it. script1_2.R is not complete, but will contain the correct data.
